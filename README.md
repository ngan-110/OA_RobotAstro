<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This is a class final project.

For our project, we have decided to build our own AI astronomer which determines the most searched objects in a given day and gets the coordinates of said objects through a DSS (Digitized Sky Survey) query. The project itself can be navigated through a simple and easily understandable website.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Methods:

- [ ] Collect data from space news sites: [website_scrapping.py](https://github.com/ngan-110/OA_RobotAstro/blob/main/Astro-Website/COMPONENTS/website_scrapping.py):
    - Websites: https://www.space.com/science-astronomy, https://www.sciencenews.org/topic/astronomy, https://www.nature.com/natastron/news-and-comment, https://phys.org/space-news/
    - Write article headlines and links to [headlines.txt](https://github.com/ngan-110/OA_RobotAstro/blob/main/Astro-Website/DATA/headlines.txt) and [links.txt](https://github.com/ngan-110/OA_RobotAstro/blob/main/Astro-Website/DATA/links.txt) 
- [ ] Process keywords [keyword_processing.py](https://github.com/ngan-110/OA_RobotAstro/blob/main/Astro-Website/COMPONENTS/keyword_processing.py)
    - Use nltk for language and POS tagging
    - Find most popular topics:
        - Read [headlines.txt](https://github.com/ngan-110/OA_RobotAstro/blob/main/Astro-Website/DATA/links.txt)
        - Get nouns with nltk
        - Write nouns in a dictionary and track count in headlines.
        - Exclude generic words, websites, org names
        - Get the top 10 words with the highest counts
        - Write these words in [popular_topics.txt](https://github.com/ngan-110/OA_RobotAstro/blob/main/Astro-Website/DATA/popular_topics.txt) and their occurrences
- [ ] Find object names from popular topics list:
    [back_search.py](https://github.com/ngan-110/OA_RobotAstro/blob/main/Astro-Website/COMPONENTS/back_search.py)
    - Use genism for summaries and object locating
        - Search all headlines for top words
        - Scrape articles from their corresponding links
        - Create 40\% sized summaries of each article 
        - Filter through summaries with a large list of object names accumulated from multiple databases
        - Create list of final object names [list_objects.txt](https://github.com/ngan-110/OA_RobotAstro/blob/main/Astro-Website/DATA/list_objects.txt)
- [ ] Search top topics in databases to find more information 
    about the objects, the coordinates, and populate to HTML: [popular_object_to_html.py](https://github.com/ngan-110/OA_RobotAstro/blob/main/Astro-Website/COMPONENTS/popular_object_to_html.py):
    - Reverse search using keywords on websites
    - Get exact objects names
    - Get objects' coordinates from databases, can feed object name to https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_form, use Astropy
    - Determine if objects are observable, flag, and move to the next object if not observable
    - Use coordinates RA and Dec to get image 
              from https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_form
    - Save information about objects: coordinates and images and update on HTML files
- [ ] Create a user interface (website) that:
    - Displays images of the most-searched objects (catalog and originally taken), general information about each object (ie. each's location in the sky)
    - Includes a link to GitHub documentation
    - Includes an 'About Us' page, a page about the history of the stellarium telescope, a project 'README' page, and possibly additional informational pages
